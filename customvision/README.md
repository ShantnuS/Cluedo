 #### 3. Create New Project with the followeirng settings:
-   Name: CluedoCustomVision
    
-   Description: Train an Object Detection model to identify the location of murder weapons within an image of a room
    
-   Resource: cluedocogservice
    
-   Project Types: Object Detection
    
-   Domains: General [A1]

#### 4. Click Create Project. Wait for the project to be created and opened in the browser.

## Add and Tag Images
To train an object detection model, you need to upload images that contain the classes you want the model to identify, and tag them to indicate bounding boxes for each object instance.
1.  Download and extract the training images from [here](https://github.com/alllee/cluedo/blob/main/customvision/better.zip). The extracted folder contains a collection of images of weapons scattered in a room.
    

2.  In the Custom Vision portal, in your object detection project, select Add Images and upload all of the images in the extracted folder.
    

3.  After the images have been uploaded, select the first one to open it.
    

4.  Hold the mouse over any object in the image until an automatically detected region is displayed like the image below. Then select the object, and if necessary resize the region to surround it.

5. Alternatively, you can simply drag around the object to create a region. When the region surrounds the object, add a new tag with the appropriate object type (Lead Pipe, Dagger, Rope, Wrench, Revolver, Candlestick) as shown here:

6. Select and tag each other object in the image, resizing the regions and adding new tags as required

7.  Use the > link on the right to go to the next image, and tag its objects. Then just keep working through the entire image collection, tagging each Lead Pipe, Dagger, Rope, Wrench, Revolver, Candlestick.

8.  When you have finished tagging the last image, close the Image Detail editor and on the Training Images page, under Tags, select Tagged to see all of your tagged images:

## Train and Test a Model
1.  In the Custom Vision project, click Train to train an object detection model using the tagged images. Select the Quick Training option.
    
2.  Wait for training to complete (it might take ten minutes or so), and then review the Precision, Recall, and mAP performance metrics - these measure the prediction accuracy of the classification model. Take note of the performance per tag â€“ which weapon has the highest precision?

3.  At the top right of the page, click Quick Test, and then in the Image URL box, enter INSERT FOLDER HERE(Please help me upload this [folder](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/alllee/Epw1Rd8R2K5Plm-2UDLWG6QB_AX3mljbXeu8jfplVIjK6A?e=5bhe0d)) and view the prediction that is generated. Increase the threshold to 90%  and observe the results. What weapons have been identified in which rooms?
