# **Introduction**

This repository contains workshops and content for the Cluedo: An AI Mystery workshop.

## Who it's for

This workshop is aimed at individuals with an interest in AI but with no experience of the cloud artificial intelligence platform and services, who would like some experience deploying and consuming AI services in no-code environments on Azure. 

The outcome is hopefully to boost knowledge of confidence in starting to use these components.
